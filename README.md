# Landing-page
The Odin Landing Project provided a webdesign for me to use HTML and CSS to design a replica using the style guide and color.
The following are the skills I learnt:
1. Coming more comfortable with the CSS Flexbox model, especially justify-content and align-item rules and how amazing CSS can turn just a HTML into a full webpage.
2. Practising and familaizing myself with Git and Github
3. Working on someone project for days and finally getting it done.
